Glossary
========

.. glossary::

   associated contig
      Alternate configuration (phase) of a portion of a primary contig*. See :ref:`this <primary_vs_associated>`
      discussion on primary vs associated contigs

   compound path
      multi-paths from a single source to a single sink in a graph

   contig
      contiguous sequence output from a genome assembler

   error correction
      The process of combining data from multiple raw sequences with random error profile
      together to eliminate the errors.

   full-pass subread
      A subread that begins at one adapter sequence and ends at another adapter sequence. A
      full-pass subread does not begin or end in the middle of an insert sequence.

   haplotig
      Contig from specific haplotype

   pread
      Pre-assembled Reads, error corrected reads through the pre-assembly process.

   pre-assembly
      Error correction process assembling raw sequences to generate high qualityy consensus for the
      final step of assembly.

   primary contig
      contig which captures a contiguous part of a genome regardless the variations due to the
      variation between haplotypes associated contig generated by alternative paths from a portion
      in the primary contig

   proper overlap
      read overlaps without unaligned overhangs:

   Quiver
      A highly accurate consensus and variant caller that can generate 99.999% accurate consensus
      sequences using local realignment and the full range of quality scores associated with
      Pacific Biosciences reads. Part of the SMRT® Analysis suite.

   rawreads
      Uncorrected raw SMRTcell movie data

   simple path
      a path without any branches in the assembly graph

   string graph
      see `The fragment assembly string graph <http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/21/suppl_2/ii79.abstract>`_
      by Eugene W. Myers, 2005

   subread
      Each polymerase read is partitioned to form one or more subreads, which contain sequence
      from a single pass of a polymerase on a single strand of an insert within a SMRTbell™
      template and no adapter sequences. The subreads contain the full set of quality values and
      kinetic measurements. Subreads are useful for applications like de novo assembly,
      resequencing, base modification analysis, and so on.
